Deep link redirect issue solution: https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/issues/977
For Github try device flow to avoid having the secret https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#device-flow

### Github connecting steps:
1. create an oauth application and assign your own clientid / secret because of the api rate limit.
2. create a github account
3. create an organization with name starting with **altrcloud**
4. give permission to the organization via: https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/:clientId
5. connect user via the application.

TODO: 
1. check & renew token after expiration

### scripts
generate **freezed** objects: ```flutter pub run build_runner build```

### Suggested names:
- AltCloud/AltSky (Alternative cloud)
- CloudFusion
- MultiCloudHub
- CloudBalancer / FreeCloudBalancer
- CloudMate
- Storify
- CloudMosaic
- CloudUnity
- SkyManager
- CloudFlow

### High-Level Plan

**Requirements**:
    - Cloud storage providers (Git, Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, Amazon S3, Box, ...).
    - OAuth 2.0 authentication for each provider.
    - Client-side data balancing algorithm to distribute files across connected accounts.
    - Data management features (upload, download, search, delete, sync, etc.).
    - UI screens for login, cloud account management, file upload,
            and file management.

**Security Considerations**:
    - Securely store authentication tokens and user credentials.
    - Implement error handling and data validation to ensure the app's robustness.

**Features**:
    - User authentication and connection of multiple cloud storage accounts.
    - Display current storage usage and quotas.
    - Upload files and automatically distribute them across connected accounts.
    - Download and synchronize files from multiple accounts.
    - File management (delete, move, rename).
    - Notification and error handling.
    - Unified Dashboard: 
        Combined Storage Overview: Display total, used, and available storage across all connected accounts.
        Account Management: Add, remove, and manage connected cloud storage accounts from different providers.
    - File Management: Upload and Download: Ability to upload and download files to and from any connected cloud storage account.
    - Automatic File Distribution: Distribute files across multiple cloud accounts based on available storage space.
    - File Syncing: Synchronize files between local storage and cloud accounts, as well as between different cloud accounts.
    - Batch Operations: Perform batch uploads, downloads, deletions, and other operations
    - Rename and Delete Files: Rename or delete files directly from the application.
    - Folder Management: Create, rename, and delete folders across different cloud storage providers.
    - Unified Search: Search for files across all connected cloud storage accounts.
    - Advanced Filtering: Filter files by size, type, date modified, and other criteria.
    - Storage Alerts: Notifications when storage quotas are nearing limits.
    - Usage Analytics: Detailed analytics on storage usage per account and overall.
    - End-to-End Encryption: Option for users to encrypt files before uploading them to cloud storage.
    - Parallel Uploads/Downloads: Optimize file transfer speeds by supporting parallel uploads and downloads.
    - Caching Mechanism: Implement caching for faster access to frequently used files.

## Show storage space usage per cloud provider
```dart

class CloudStorageDashboard extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CloudStorageDashboardState createState() => _CloudStorageDashboardState();
}

class _CloudStorageDashboardState extends State<CloudStorageDashboard> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Multi-Cloud Manager'),
        actions: [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.add),
            onPressed: () {
              // Code to connect a new cloud storage account
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
        child: ListView(
          children: [
            CloudStorageCard(provider: 'Google Drive', used: 10, total: 15),
            CloudStorageCard(provider: 'Dropbox', used: 5, total: 20),
            CloudStorageCard(provider: 'OneDrive', used: 2, total: 5),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Code to upload a file
              },
              child: Text('Upload File'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CloudStorageCard extends StatelessWidget {
  final String provider;
  final double used;
  final double total;

  CloudStorageCard({required this.provider, required this.used, required this.total});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Card(
      child: ListTile(
        title: Text(provider),
        subtitle: LinearProgressIndicator(
          value: used / total,

```

### Data Balancing Algorithm Example
```dart
import 'dart:math';

class CloudStorageAccount {
  final String provider;
  final int totalQuota;
  int usedQuota;

  CloudStorageAccount(this.provider, this.totalQuota, this.usedQuota);
}

void balanceData(List<CloudStorageAccount> accounts, int fileSize) {
  accounts.sort((a, b) => (a.totalQuota - a.usedQuota).compareTo(b.totalQuota - b.usedQuota));
  for (var account in accounts) {
    if (account.totalQuota - account.usedQuota >= fileSize) {
      account.usedQuota += fileSize;
      print('File of size $fileSize uploaded to ${account.provider}');
      return;
    }
  }
  print('Not enough space in any account to upload the file');
}

void main() {
  var accounts = [
    CloudStorageAccount('Google Drive', 15000, 5000),
    CloudStorageAccount('Dropbox', 20000, 12000),
    CloudStorageAccount('OneDrive', 5000, 1000),
  ];

  balanceData(accounts, 3000); // Adjust file size as needed
}
```
